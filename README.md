# Midnight Space Trader

A simple TUI space trading game in the style of _[Space Trader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Trader_(Palm_OS))_ and _SolarWars_ for Palm OS (which in turn was inspired by [DopeWars](https://github.com/benmwebb/dopewars)).

This version is more similar to _SolarWars_ with enhancements than _Space Trader_, though it is influenced heavily by both.

### Naming

Why "Midnight"? That's the name of my cat and adding it sounds cool while also absolving me of the need to find an actually original name for this project.
